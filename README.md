7. Area of a Triangle
Write a function that takes two numbers that represent the base and the height of a triangle and returns the area of the triangle.

8. Divisable by Value
Write a function that takes in two integers. The function will check if the first integer is divisible by the second integer and return a boolean.

9. ERA
A pitcherâ€™s ERA (earned runs average) is calculated by multiplying the earned runs times total innings in the game (usually 9) and then dividing by the total innings that the pitcher pitched. Write a function that assumes that there were 9 innings in the game and takes in two numbers that represent the earned runs and the innings pitched. The function should return the ERA.
